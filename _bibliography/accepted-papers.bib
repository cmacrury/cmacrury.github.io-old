abstract = {In the Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem, products composed of up to $L$ resources are sold to stochastically arriving customers. We take a randomized rounding approach to NRM, motivated by the modern tool of Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an online policy that satisfies the resource constraints with probability 1, while (approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the fractional solution.

In NRM and revenue management problems, customer substitution induces a negative correlation between products being demanded, making it difficult to apply the standard definition of OCRS. We start by deriving a more powerful notion of "random-element" OCRS that achieves a guarantee of $1/(1+L)$ for NRM with customer substitution, matching a common benchmark in the literature.
We show this benchmark is unbeatable for all integers $L$ that are the power of a prime number, using a construction based on finite affine planes.
We then show how to beat this benchmark under any of three assumptions: 1) no customer substitution (i.e., in the standard OCRS setting);
2) products comprise one item from each of up to $L$ groups; or
3) customers arrive in a uniformly random (instead of fixed adversarial) order.
Finally, we show that under both assumptions 1) and 3), it is possible to do better than offline CRS when $L\ge 5$.

Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to $L$ items, and buyers being single-minded is akin to having no substitution.
Our result under assumption 2) implies that $1/(1+L)$ can be beaten for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of $L$ partition matroids, a problem of interest.
In sum, our paper shows how to apply OCRS to all of these problems and establishes a surprising separation in the achievable guarantees when substitution is involved,
under general resource constraints parametrized by $L$.},

Given an edge-colored graph, the goal of the proportional fair matching problem is to find a maximum weight matching
while ensuring proportional representation (with respect to the number of edges) of each color. The colors may correspond to demographic groups or other protected traits where we seek to ensure
roughly equal representation from each group.
It is known that, assuming ETH, it is impossible to approximate the problem with $\ell$ colors in time subexponential in $\ell$, even on unweighted path graphs. Further, even determining the existence of a non-empty matching satisfying proportionality is NP-Hard.
To overcome this hardness, we relax the stringent proportional fairness constraints to a probabilistic notion. We introduce a definition we call $\delta$-ProbablyAlmostFair, where we ensure proportionality up to a factor of at most $(1 + \delta)$ for some small $\delta>0$ with high probability. The violation $\delta$ can be brought arbitrarily close to $0$ for some good instances with large values of matching size. We propose and analyze simple and fast algorithms for bipartite graphs that achieve
constant-factor approximation guarantees, and return a $\delta$-ProbablyAlmostFair matching.

We give a result for the case where instead of a tight estimate for each variable's expected one-step change, we have only an upper bound.

note = {Minor revision in <i> Operations Research </i>},
abstract = {We study the performance of sequential contention resolution and matching algorithms on random graphs with vanishing edge probabilities. The regime with vanishing edge probabilities is interesting for several reasons: 1) in applications such as online advertising, an edge represents a customer clicking an ad and the probability of any such event is tiny; 2) in settings where worst-case instances for contention resolution schemes are known, they have vanishing edge probabilities; 3) this is the main regime of interest in the literature on Erdős–Rényi random graphs.

When the edges of the graph are processed in an adversarially-chosen order, we derive a new OCRS that is $0.382$-selectable, attaining the "independence benchmark" from the literature under the vanishing edge probabilities assumption.
Complementary to this positive result, we show that no OCRS can be more than $0.390$-selectable, significantly improving upon the upper bound of $0.428$ from the literature.
Meanwhile, when the edges of the graph are processed in a uniformly random order, we show that the simple greedy CRS which accepts all active and feasible edges is $1/2$-selectable.
This result is tight due to a known upper bound.
Finally, when the algorithm can choose the processing order, we show that a slight tweak to the random order---give each vertex a random priority and process edges in lexicographic order---results in a strictly better OCRS that is $1-log(2-1/e)\approx 0.510$-selectable.
Our positive results also apply to online matching on $1$-uniform random graphs with vanishing (non-identical) edge probabilities, extending and unifying some results from that literature.},

we show how to select each element which arrives at time $y \in [0,1]$ with probability \textit{exactly} $c(y)$.
We provide a rigorous algorithmic framework for achieving this, which discretizes the time interval and also needs to sample its past execution to ensure these exact selection probabilities.
We showcase
our framework in the context of online contention resolution schemes for matching with random-order vertex arrivals. For bipartite graphs with two-sided arrivals, we design a $(1+e^{-2})/2 \approx 0.567$-selectable RCRS, which we also show to be tight.
Next, we show that the presence of short odd-length cycles is the only barrier to attaining a (tight) $(1+e^{-2})/2$-selectable RCRS on general graphs. By generalizing our bipartite RCRS, we design an RCRS for graphs with odd-length girth $g$ which is $(1+e^{-2})/2$-selectable as $g \rightarrow \infty$. This convergence happens very rapidly: for triangle-free
graphs (i.e., $g \ge 5$), we attain a  $121/240 + 7/16 e^2 \approx 0.563$-selectable RCRS.
Finally, for general graphs we improve on the $8/15 \approx 0.533$-selectable RCRS of (Fu et al., 2021) and design an RCRS which is at least $0.535$-selectable.
Due to the reduction of (Ezra et al., 2020), our bounds yield a $0.535$-competitive (respectively, $(1+e^{-2})/2$-competitive) algorithm for prophet secretary matching

In each step, a subset of edges X is independently sampled according to a distribution D. The player then selects one edge e from X, and adds e to its current graph. For a fixed monotone increasing graph property P, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy P in as few steps as possible. Through appropriate choices of D, the D-process generalizes well-studied adaptive random graph processes, such as the Achlioptas process and the semi-random graph process
We prove a sufficient condition for the existence of a sharp threshold for P in the D-process. For the semi-random process, we use this condition to prove the existence of a sharp threshold when P corresponds to being Hamiltonian or to containing a perfect matching. These are the first results for the semi-random graph process which show the existence of a sharp threshold when P corresponds to containing a sparse spanning graph. Using a separate analytic argument, we show that each sharp threshold is of the form CPn for some fixed constant CP>0. This answers two of the open problems proposed by Ben-Eliezer et al. (SODA 2020) in the affirmative. Unlike similar results which establish sharp thresholds for certain distributions and properties, we establish the existence of sharp thresholds without explicitly identifying asymptotically optimal strategies.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we identify determinants of pandemic spread in urban populations. Specifically, we develop a multi-agent simulation framework to model virus spread in complex networks.
	Our agents periodically commute between home and work via a combination of walking routes
	and public transit, and make decisions intelligently based upon their location, available routes,
	and expectations of public transport arrival times. Our infection scheme allows for different
	contagiousness levels, as a function of the virus’s strain and where the agents interact (i.e.,
	inside or outside). Our results show that the pandemic’s scale is heavily impacted by the network’s structure, and the decision making of the agents. In particular, the progression of the
	pandemic greatly differs when agents primarily infect each other in a crowded urban transportation system, opposed to while walking. Additionally, the results show that local subgraph
	characteristics, including topology, structure, and statistics such as its degree distribution and
	density, affect the viruses’ transmission rates. We also assess the effect of modifying the public
	transport’s running frequency on the spread of two different virus strains (with different levels
	of contagiousness). In particular, lowering the running frequency can discourage agents from
	taking public transportation too often, especially for shorter distances. On the other hand, the
	low frequency contributes to more crowded streetcars or subway cars if the policy is not designed
	correctly, which is why such an analysis may prove valuable for finding “sweet spots” that optimize the system. The proposed approach has been validated on real world data, and a model
	of the transportation network of downtown Toronto. The framework used is flexible and can
	be easily adjusted to model other urban environments, and additional forms of transportation
	(such as carpooling, ride-share and more).},

This paper analyzes OCRS's for resource constraints defined by matchings in graphs, a fundamental structure in combinatorial optimization. We consider two dimensions of variants: the elements being presented in adversarial or random order; and the graph being bipartite or general. We improve the state of the art for all combinations of variants, both in terms of algorithmic guarantees and impossibility results. Some of our algorithmic guarantees are best-known even compared to Contention Resolution Schemes that can choose the order of arrival or are offline.

We consider the online bipartite stochastic matching problem with known i.d. (independently distributed) online vertex arrivals. In this problem, when an online vertex arrives, its weighted edges must be
probed (queried) to determine if they exist, based on known edge probabilities. Our algorithms operate
in the probe-commit model, in that if a probed edge exists, it must be used in the matching. Additionally,
each online node has a downward-closed probing constraint on its adjacent edges which indicates which
sequences of edge probes are allowable. Our setting generalizes the commonly studied patience (or timeout) constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to an online node’s adjacent edges.
Most notably, this includes non-uniform edge probing costs (specified by knapsack/budget constraint).
We extend a recently introduced configuration LP to the known i.d. setting, and also provide the first
proof that it is a relaxation of an optimal offline probing algorithm (the offline adaptive benchmark). Using this LP,
we establish new competitive bounds all of which generalize the standard non-stochastic setting when edges do not need to be probed (i.e., exist with certainty).

      abstract={Motivated by the Beck-Fiala conjecture, we study the discrepancy problem in two related models of random hypergraphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. In the first ({\em edge-independent}) model, a random hypergraph $H_1$ is constructed by fixing a parameter $p$ and allowing each of the $n$ vertices to join each of the $m$ edges independently with probability $p$. In the parameter range in which $pn \rightarrow \infty$ and $pm \rightarrow \infty$, we show that with high probability (\whp) $H_1$ has discrepancy at least $\Omega(2^{-n/m} \sqrt{pn})$ when $m = O(n)$, and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{pn \log\gamma })$ when $m \gg n$,
where $\gamma = \min\{ m/n, pn\}$. In the second ({\em edge-dependent}) model, $d$ is fixed and each vertex of $H_2$ independently joins exactly $d$ edges uniformly at random.
We obtain analogous results for this model by generalizing the techniques used for the edge-independent model with $p=d/m$. Namely, for $d \rightarrow \infty$ and $dn/m \rightarrow \infty$, we prove that \whp\ $H_{2}$ has discrepancy at least $\Omega(2^{-n/m} \sqrt{dn/m})$ when $m = O(n)$, and at least $\Omega(\sqrt{(dn/m) \log\gamma})$ when $m \gg n$, where $\gamma =\min\{m/n, dn/m\}$. 
Furthermore, we obtain nearly matching asymptotic upper bounds on the discrepancy in both models (when $p=d/m$), in the dense regime of $m \gg n$. Specifically, we apply the partial colouring lemma of Lovett and Meka to show that \whp\ $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ each have discrepancy $O( \sqrt{dn/m}  \log(m/n))$, provided $d \rightarrow \infty$, $d n/m \rightarrow \infty$ and $m \gg n$. This result is algorithmic, and together with the work of Bansal and Meka characterizes how the discrepancy of each random hypergraph model transitions from $\Theta(\sqrt{d})$ to $o(\sqrt{d})$ as $m$ varies from $m=\Theta(n)$ to $m \gg n$.}

		The semi-random graph process is a single player game in which the player is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible.

We focus on the problem of constructing a perfect matching in as few rounds as possible. In particular, we present an adaptive strategy for the player which achieves a perfect matching in $\beta n$ rounds, where the value of $\beta < 1.206$ is derived from a solution to some system of differential equations. This improves upon the previously best known upper bound of $(1+2/e+o(1)) \, n < 1.736 \, n$ rounds. We also improve the previously best lower bound of $(\ln 2 + o(1)) \, n > 0.693 \, n$ and show that the player cannot achieve the desired property in less than $\alpha n$ rounds, where the value of $\alpha > 0.932$ is derived from a solution to another system of differential equations. As a result, the gap between the upper and lower bounds is decreased roughly four times.      }

  abstract = {We study p-Faulty Search, a variant of the classic cow-path optimization problem, where a unit speed robot searches the half-line (or 1-ray) for a hidden item. The searcher is probabilistically faulty, and detection of the item with each visitation is an independent Bernoulli trial whose probability of success p is known. The objective is to minimize the worst case expected detection time, relative to the distance of the hidden item to the origin. A variation of the same problem was first proposed by Gal in 1980. Then in 2003, Alpern and Gal [The Theory of Search Games and Rendezvous] proposed a so-called monotone solution for searching the line (2-rays); that is, a trajectory in which the newly searched space increases monotonically in each ray and in each iteration. Moreover, they conjectured that an optimal trajectory for the 2-rays problem must be monotone. We disprove this conjecture when the search domain is the half-line (1-ray). We provide a lower bound for all monotone algorithms, which we also match with an upper bound. Our main contribution is the design and analysis of a sequence of refined search strategies, outside the family of monotone algorithms, which we call t-sub-monotone algorithms. Such algorithms induce performance that is strictly decreasing with t, and for all p \in (0,1). The value of t quantifies, in a certain sense, how much our algorithms deviate from being monotone, demonstrating that monotone algorithms are sub-optimal when searching the half-line.},

      abstract={
Within the context of stochastic probing with commitment, we consider
the online stochastic matching problem; that is, the one-sided online bipartite
matching problem where edges adjacent to an online node must be probed to
determine if they exist based on edge probabilities that become known when an online vertex arrives.  If a probed edge
exists, it must be used in the matching (if possible). We consider the
competitiveness of online algorithms in both the adversarial order model (AOM)
and the random order model (ROM). More specifically, we consider a bipartite stochastic graph  
$G = (U,V,E)$ where $U$ is the set of offline vertices, $V$ is the set of online vertices and $G$
has edge probabilities $(p_{e})_{e \in E}$ and edge weights $(w_{e})_{e \in E}$.
Additionally, $G$ has probing constraints $(\scr{C}_{v})_{v \in V}$,  where $\scr{C}_v$
indicates which sequences of edges adjacent to an online vertex $v$ can be probed. We assume that $U$ is
known in advance, and that $\scr{C}_v$, together with the
edge probabilities and weights adjacent to an online vertex  are only revealed  when the online vertex arrives. 
This model generalizes the various settings of the classical bipartite matching problem,
and so our main contribution is in making progress towards understanding which classical results extend to the stochastic
probing model.
